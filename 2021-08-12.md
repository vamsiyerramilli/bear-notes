I started compiling my “evergreen notes” into true evergreens, where the idea is that these are condensed blobs of knowledge, and not just a bunch of points from different books thrown in separate notes. The same note needs to carry all the relevant information about a particular topic - atomic notes are a weirdly complex concept to think about. The core concept in all these systems is about how do you write that particular atomic note. What do you define as atomic, as atomic in one sense could be too broad in another. In such cases, I guess the idea is to rely on your instinct and condense a topic as much as possible into one single note. That’s when they start becoming densely linked, as each note is no longer just something which carries one part of knowledge on a particular topic, but provides a rich tapestry of the entire information on the topic.

All these attempts at different systems should not be considered a waste, but rather an experiment through which I am able to refine my own process of working with knowledge. The reason I am failing at it so many times is because this is not something that we are taught from childhood, and something that I am trying to come up with on my own. The reason I am seeing all these attempts as a failure is because I am only looking at the finished products that others on YouTube have for the systems and it all looks too well-designed. The problem is that we are not seeing the actual hard work and failure behind their successful model of working - all of this is well hidden from us and all we get to see is the final product, which makes me feel like a loser. It is okay to fail - it is okay to fail multiple times, as long as you pick yourself up and are willing to go at it again. The 4th or 5th or nth set up is bound to work well enough that it keeps me interested. The important thing is that I learn from my mistakes. My mistakes with these systems till now include:
1. Tried **replicating other people’s structures** without thinking about how they use it
2. Tried to set up really simple systems without thinking about what the **feedback loops** were going to be
3. Each time, the core problem was **how the notes were structured** - they are a tad too granular and need to be more dense, in order to ensure the linking is also dense and meaningful
4. Tried to keep the original context alive in the notes, which should not be the case. The **notes should be stripped of the original context and only considered in the context of the other notes that are already present in the system**. The original context can be preserved in the daily notes or literature notes, but never in the evergreens
5. Not **having a defined outcome** for these notes
