# Simple structures are usually modular and allow more flexibility in set up
We can often set up the most complex systems using a combination of simple systems that work well together. This is something that holds true for tools (using the relevant tools for dedicated purposes is better than trying to use Notion for everything), workflows (being able to follow a few simple steps for the different parts, rather than doing a large sequence of steps for the same task), habits, etc.

These simple structures could often just be stacked upon one another or laid out in parallel to create a more complex workflow, which is then custom designed to fit the specific needs.

A couple of examples for this are:
1. Notion has a LOT of different features in order to enable you to do everything from note taking to managing to do lists to company wiki to databases, etc. With all these features, however, there are always tradeoffs that come into the picture, as features start clashing with one another.
2. When we try to implement these same features in their dedicated apps, it might become much easier to manage the workflow. For example, for me, Bear is great for taking notes (quick everywhere, not a lot of confusion around how something works [[Predictability is important for the formation of habits]]), Things is great for managing tasks, and I do not even need most of the other features that Notion has to offer.
