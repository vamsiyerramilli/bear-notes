## Avoid using will power as a fuel for doing things
* when there is a task that is defined to help achieve a certain goal, and it is meaningful, it is easier to do the task. The goal needs to be understood and aligned with our personal goals.
> Every task that is interesting, meaningful and well-defined will be done, because there is no conflict between long- and short-term interests. Having a meaningful and well-defined task beats willpower every time

* This is the point of a system - it liberates you from expending mental resources to make decisions and instead allows you to focus on your task at hand
> If you can trust the system, you can let go of the attempt to hold everything together in your head and you can start focusing on what is important: The content, the argument and the ideas.
