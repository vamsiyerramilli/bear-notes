# Counterintuitive insights should be processed with an open mind
It is easy to understand the intuitive insights, as they are confirming the information or beliefs that we already hold with ourselves. However, we often find the most interesting and important insights on the counterintuitive side of the coin, which tend to be shunned as outliers, but are actually just important findings which we are unable to fit into our existing #e/mental-models#. 

Allowing ourselves to think through these situations and understand why the situation is the way it is allows us to grow our own thinking and develop our existing mental models, and maybe even add a few more models, which allow us to process the information better in future

1. [[Compounding]] is not intuitive at all, as we tend to think of accumulation as addition, rather than multiplication. This is mostly down to the fact that usually when we deal with accumulation, we are looking at small amounts and for a short period of time. However, true compounding is multiplicative in nature, where small amounts multiply over time to result in a much bigger (almost counterintuitively big) outcomes
2. Price inelasticity is a weird concept to think about - conventional wisdom dictates that lower prices should always drive up the demand. And yet, the opposite of this often comes to life. A great example of it is from the Stock Markets -> more people buy stocks when they see the prices climbing, and not when they are at their lowest
3. It is difficult to be optimistic about the future when we are actively putting out fires every single day in our life. This holds true with relationships, with companies, with the stock market, the world, etc. However, over the long run, most aspects of the world only improve, and thus, there is always an argument to be made for optimism
4. Bad short term results are often considered a prelude to long term failure, and this often inhibits growth and innovation.
	* We miss the point of [[Compounding]] here again, where very small and marginal improvements in the system in the short term - which have no real outcome right then - could add up to potentially large impact in the future
	* This happens with habits, money / investments, knowledge, and probably other areas which we might not directly identify or recognise 
5. Moving away from methods and programs that work to allow for experimentation is a concept that many managers find counterintuitive and counterproductive. It does not make intuitive sense to stop pushing something that works today, and to experiment with something new - something untested, which has a potential for failure.
	* Experimentation allows organisations and individuals to identify new “tails” - ideas that are at the tail ends of the bell curve, and are usually the ones that are the most successful, both commercially and by popularity

* [[Confirmation bias]]
	* We tend to search for, favour, recall and interpret information that supports or confirms our previously help beliefs and values. This usually affects us when we are trying to learn something new or contradictory that what we already know (irrespective of it being right or wrong), and could potentially play a big role in why we are bad at interpreting counterintuitive outcomes ([[Counterintuitive insights should be processed with an open mind]])
* [[Design strategies that help multiply the inputs over time, and not just add up]]
	* While inputs tend to be additive in the short term, they usually end up becoming multiplicative in the long run, through consistency and avoiding stupid decisions ([[Consistent marginal additions accumulate over time to significant amounts]], [[Time is the secret ingredient of compounding]]) - this is not something that seems very obvious at first, but does hold up in more than one field ([[Counterintuitive insights should be processed with an open mind]])
* [[Confirmation Bias plays a significant part in influencing our insight into different topics]]
	* This also affects the way that we look at data and analyses in our life - areas where we tend to look for new patterns and identify insights that we might be missing out on - but might only end up grasping insights that strengthen our current understanding, rather than look for something new or counterintuitive from it.
