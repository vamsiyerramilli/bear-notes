# Time is the secret ingredient of compounding
There are two ingredients which make up a good recipe for compounding - consistency, which is discussed in [[Consistent marginal additions accumulate over time to significant amounts]], and time.

Value builds up, relations solidify, habits are formed and knowledge accretes when we are consistent with our efforts or inputs for a long enough period of time. In the short term, our inputs are often additive, but when we are consistent with them for a much longer period of time is when we start to realise the true potential of [[Compounding]]

A great example of this from [[Psychology of Money]] is about how [[Warren Buffett]]â€™s wealth built up over time - he started investing at the age of 10, and was worth about $1 Mn by the age of 30. Today, he's worth $84.5 Bn, of which some $84.1 Bn was made after he was 50.

	* While inputs tend to be additive in the short term, they usually end up becoming multiplicative in the long run, through consistency and avoiding stupid decisions ([[Consistent marginal additions accumulate over time to significant amounts]], [[Time is the secret ingredient of compounding]]) - this is not something that seems very obvious at first, but does hold up in more than one field ([[Counterintuitive insights should be processed with an open mind]])
