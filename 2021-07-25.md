	* We should remember that tools are supposed to help our workflow, and not define them
	* We use tools as a means to an end - using a tool a particular way is not the end itself
	* With any tool, we should try and replicate the workflows that suit us best, so we can get on with what we are trying to do - otherwise, we will spend a lot more time on the tool itself
