19:04 - Started reading [[The General Theory on Employment, Interest and Money]] by [[John Maynard Keynes]]

**What’s the book about?**
- book written for economists, which anyone is free to read
- talks about the theory that dictates (or is supposed to dictate) a lot of the practical applications - and is in contradiction (or at least opposition) to the classical theories of economics held at the time
- A study on the forces which determine changes in the overall output and employment
- monetary economies are markets where the changing view of the future influences the employment rates today (not just in direction, but also magnitude)
- “the difficulty lies, not in the new ideas, but in escaping from the old ones, which ramify, for those brought up as most of us have been, into every corner of our minds” -> a beautiful statement about how confirmation Bias comes into play and also how we are much less receptive to something that is in direct opposition to what we already know, irrespective of how obvious or easy it might be

* This is a really tough book to read and something that really needs to be read in detail and thoroughly, while taking enough pauses and breaks, as the concepts are complex, the language is a little archaic and also technical, and the idea is to understand what is truly being said rather than just go through what’s written on the screen
