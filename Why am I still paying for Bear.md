# Why am I still paying for Bear?
Bear is and will remain my note taking app of choice for mobile and syncing with the laptop. This is, by far, the best note taking platform I’ve come up against and would love to continue this for the rest of my life, as long as the team continues to maintain the app. 

It’s one of the simplest apps that I’ve encountered and is actually the first one I found in my entire search for a good notes app. Even right now, when I’m typing in here, it feels very natural for some reason. Maybe because I also have a lot of experience typing in Bear through my journaling habit. 

Given this, do I feel Roam is worth it? Yes, because of the whole outliner features and back links, I’d still love to keep Roam as my place for the more intense notes - the knowledge notes. 

I could use Bear for everything but I’ll need to figure out a few things and make do with using search instead of back links - not the worst, to be honest, but it’s easy to be tempted when you don’t have this feature. Maybe I’ll cancel my Roam subscription and just use Bear? For fuck’s sake, this would be the third or fourth time that I do this, if I go through with it. 

Bear offers a rather clean way to working. The problem is the lack of any form of workspacing, which means I can’t set up a clean install while retaining everything from the previous workspace - ::**a la Roam Graphs.**::

### What does Bear not have?

1. Backlinks
2. Transclusion
3. Outliner features such as child nodes being linked to parents
4. Fancy features such as a graph view and all

### Can all these be managed somehow?
1. Backlinks can be replaced with search of the title - it adds a little bit of friction, but honestly, that’s okay, because it means that notes and links have to be built strongly
2. Transclusion is a bigger problem. Context needs to be added well for all references. This needs to be handled through pulling in the right context every time and making it a part of the text itself. It’s no longer transclusion but a full text copy itself
3. Outlier features are something that I will really miss from Roam. This needs to be replaced with basic bullet points and using separate notes for anything that needs some serious thought and linking it to the daily note page - they can still be tagged as something under daily itself
4. Fancy features are pointless.
