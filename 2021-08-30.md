I’ll mostly switch away from Roam and just use Bear - it makes writing easier for me, and without the internet, it allows me to work in a better state of mind, as I won’t be able to browse anything. Obsidian is also great for this purpose, but it does not have the simple and clean UI of Bear, and forces a lot of decisions early on for it to be easy to use.
