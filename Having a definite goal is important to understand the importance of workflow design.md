# Having a definite goal is important to understand the importance of workflow design
Without a goal in mind, workflows do not have any North Star - a guiding principle - to be geared towards and this leads to inefficiencies and inherent problems with the system. 

::This is very vague and needs to be tightened::

An example from my own systems - I’ve been fiddling around with all these note taking systems and tools but do not know what my aim is for them. It is no surprise that I’m just switching from app to app, wondering which system works best as I struggle to make up my mind on anything. I’m always missing an aim for them and that leads to confusion. This is something that needs to be tackled systematically. Without a goal in mind, any amount of knowledge on the systems won’t help with improving knowledge.
