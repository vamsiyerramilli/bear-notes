# How are we affecting the habits and mental shortcuts of animals?
* I just heard a few dogs howl in tune to the refinery siren that goes off daily 
	* Makes me wonder - how much are we affecting the general habits of all these animals?
	* Animals, just like us, would also have a lot of their own mental shortcuts, all of which would probably be getting madly triggered by all the noise in signals around them
	* This is on top of all the other ways that we are anyway affecting them, including stealing their natural habitats, changing the landscape and altering the natural ecosystems
