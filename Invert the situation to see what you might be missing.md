# Invert the situation to see what you might be missing
It is often harder to identify the potential issues in any decision when we try to look at it from the most obvious angle that we can think of. It is hard to identify what are the factors that define a good employee, a good husband, a good friend, a good son, and so on. Similarly, it is hard to define the qualities of a good tool or a good workflow or a good investment. 

However, what is much easier to do, at least in many of these cases, is to invert the situation and ask the opposite question - what makes a bad investment? Who is a bad son? What constitutes a bad workflow? Asking this simple question helps us cut through the noise and identify the most obvious errors that we make when wearing the different hats in our lives and designing systems and workflows that are meant to help us achieve something.

> It is remarkable ho much long term advantage people like us (Munger and Buffett) have gotten by trying to be consistently “not stupid”, instead of trying to be very intelligent - Charlie Munger

This is the same principle that Michael teachers Dwight (rather, Dwight takes away from what Michael told him) in The Office:

> I always think to myself - is this something an idiot would do? If so, I do not do that thing - Dwight Schrute

Going by this approach might not help us avoid all possible issues - there will still be many issues that come our way - but we can avoid the ones that are the most obvious and have the potential to do the most damage. ([[There is an element of risk involved with all our actions]])
