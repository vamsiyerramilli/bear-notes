# Workflows should have a distinct feedback loop built into them to move towards the desired outcome
Feedback is important for us to understand how well or badly we are doing on any particular task and where we might be falling short of our intended outcome from the action. This principle of “getting feedback” is present around us in multiple aspects of life, including our career (periodic reviews, appraisal cycles), education (exams, tests, projects) , relationships (reciprocation, favours, tension), etc. This is also a big driver of learning, especially when we are young, when we learn quickly based on feedback (if you touch a hot cooker as a kid, you probably would think twice before touching it again).

When designing systems of action and workflows, we should actively look to build in feedback loops to ensure we are not restricting it to a one-way input from our end (in terms of efforts, investment, time, etc.) but also reviewing regularly how we are progressing towards the outcomes.

These feedback loops should, ideally, be distinct from the action or the workflow itself, as it makes it easier to get the right feedback. ([[A feedback loop distinct from the action helps gauge performance levels better]])
