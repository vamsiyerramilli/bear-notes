## Pre-meeting notes
### Performance of last few months
* Did a decent job over the past few months; delivered on most / all of the tasks 
* *Did well*: analytical ability, adding structure to unstructured problems and picking up complex projects
* *Improved on*:  overall business understanding, prioritisation and task handling, and insight generation
* *Things to work on*:  analytical output of the team (both in terms of streamlining and ensuring accuracy), and developing resources which will ensure better integration of codes and codebases across the team

### Damani’s performance
* Felt like I had a lot more freedom with my work in terms of picking up tasks and organising things, depending on what I felt was pressing
* Provided good context for the projects and general business 
* *Where to improve*: improved project visibility, better planning of tasks (esp. on analytics side)  - tasks are almost always ad hoc, esp. from some people, and this does not help with maintaining a smooth workflow
* *Other issue area*: sometimes, loses cool, which might be justified, but could affect the morale of the team adversely

### Issues faced
* Lack of role clarity & growth path
* Do not have enough analysts (actual analysts) on the team, so crucial tasks are almost always stuck as we (Rama, Simar and I) are usually caught up with other tasks -> also a problem when someone is on leave or might be leaving
* Still do not have any proper task handling or project visibility, which continues to be a problem - raised in the last 2 discussions

### Role elevation
* 2 pronged - technical & managerial
* Want to move into a part managerial role, if possible - was doing it in ZS with a team of 3 associates, but have also grown and learnt much more over the last couple of years
* Would also free up a part of my time + start adding more structure to the insights portion (not a lot can be done when working with people all of whom are reporting to different managers)
* Want to continue / restart working with Mads and Rune’s team, as I paused it during the AOP period and have not been able to really pick it up again
* Need to figure out ways to ensure that does not get de-prioritised every time there are tasks around Functional catchups, MBRMs, etc. - that’s on me

### If there’s time
* Thinking about when I should go for a MBA, and want to plan for it, but also want to understand how it helps
* Main concern: do not want to get passed upon for other roles or promotions just because I do not have a MBA


## Meeting notes
### Performance over last few months
* Continue to hone the good points further -> *Ownership* (exemplary and much above other points also), *coming up with more solutions* (saw a v positive movement on this after the last discussion), *ability to work with people has also improved* (comfort level improved working with Renata, and in general with Finance say pacing, AOP, etc.), 
* As you grow, people will not tell you what to do - they will just tell you what is expected of you. You will have to figure out more of what needs to be done towards improving
* Distinction between the good and the best is that the best can identify issues and unlock value for the company
* As you grow, what you will also need to understand is that you need to get work done from people who do not even report to you and that is where you have to figure out your style on how do you get work done through people (and this is not a negative thing) - we are all here to deliver something for the company
* Even a CEO needs to get work done out of the external partners - even they need to figure out the subtle art of getting stuff done out of anyone.
* *Points to improve own*: With respect to the AOP and pacing, the *structure needs to be improved* some more, and ensuring some of these errors - esp. on the AOP - need to be controlled a lot more; similarly, the loss analysis is another point needs to be picked up regularly
* AOP is a critical exercise and as we move towards an IPO, the importance of this will only increase - it is also a regular thing / periodic thing, which needs to be streamlined
* TUI pacing also needs to be improved - we do not have enough idea about what is happening here, and while some of this is also data-dependent, we need to improve the overall understanding itself -> if we give ‘x’ on 25th of a month and the final number ends up being 1.5X, it could also become 0.6x in some month, which will lead to questions
* Overall, very pleased with the performance and no complaints as such; stood up to the occasion when there is the need
### Comments on feedback for him
* We have a larger problem that there are certain blindspots in the team, which we need to solve - like configuration framework
* 
* 

### Issues faced
* *Analyst bandwidth*
	* For investor related queries -> Simar
	* Insight analysis -> Me
	* Pricing, deals, coupons -> Rama
	* Inventory -> Yogi 
	* Cancellations -> Shubham, Kunal
	* Need to come up with a solution to work amongst yourselves to come up with the right way to ensure the data is pulled
	
* From the role you are playing (raw analytics -> analytics & insights -> can grow more towards where you want to grow)
	* What is your interest?
	* Could play a trajectory of either Aman or Arushi or play a trajectory of a Mads or Rune
	* If you have made up your mind on this, you can always come back and have this conversation even in the next 4 - 6  weeks
	* Company is also moving towards a Product & Tech direction than an Operations-focus - there will also be a few roles opening up on the Product Management roles
		* Whenever such things come up, he will call it out - it requires a fair bit of project management, understanding of data and insights

### Role elevation
* 

### If there’s time
* There is no right or wrong answer - there are enough examples of people without a MBA doing good things, and the other way also
* Other way to think about this -> What do you want to do moving forward? Or do you want to switch the kind of roles you are working on? 
* For example, Mitul does not have a MBA and is still doing well in Oyo and could also switch
* There is no harm as such in doing one, but need to think about it as an investment -> are you ready for that?
* Are you okay to stay in the USA for 2-3 years after doing a MBA? Is that feasible for you? If it is from ISB or something, then you can always consider 
* A US MBA is a different ball game - it is a much more long term investment
* You should first clear up your mind on India vs US MBA, because the answer is very different between the two of them. 1 year, 30-35 lakhs compared to 2 years (and more for paying off) and about 1.5 Cr
* Other option is continue here, get a couple of promotions and explore the idea of joining an early stage start up where you will have a lot of growth
* Option in India is to go to ISB with a 5 year work experience
	* For this, you can also think of giving your GMAT this year and having that sorted
	* You can then also decide 3 months later so you still have the option of applying
