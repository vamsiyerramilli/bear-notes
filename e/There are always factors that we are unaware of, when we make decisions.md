# There are always factors that we are unaware of, when we make decisions
All the scenarios that we come across in life are usually affected by factors which can be classified into one of the following four buckets:
1. “Known-knowns” -> factors that you are aware of and are knowledgeable about
2. “Known-unknowns” -> factors that you are aware of, but not knowledgeable about
3. “Unknown-unknowns” -> factors that you are not aware of, and are not knowledgeable about
4. “Unknown-knowns” -> factors that you are not aware of, but are knowledgeable about

When we evaluate any situation or decision, we often focus on categories 1 and 2 from above, and try to solve for any issues that might arise from them. We might also be able to solve for the problems that might arise from category 4, through our subconscious knowledge. 

However, when we are faced with category 3 challenges, we are mostly caught out, as we have neither prepared for the challenge (as we are unaware of the factor itself) and are not knowledgeable enough on how it can be solved.
