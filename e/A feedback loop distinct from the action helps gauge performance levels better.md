# A feedback loop distinct from the action helps gauge performance levels better
When the feedback loop and the core action rely on the same set of skills, there is a higher chance of error when it comes to performance measurement. This is driven by [[Dunning Kruger Effect]], where [[We are overconfident about our own ability and knowledge when we are ignorant]]. For example, if you are reading a new topic and want to test your understanding of it, merely scanning your brain for the understanding will give you the impression that you are now well-versed in the subject, as your only feedback loop is reliant on your own knowledge (which is limited, and possibly wrong or incomplete).

However, if these feedback loops are built such that they rely on a separate set of skills, there is a better chance of us correctly estimating our performances (provided we are able to use this skill effectively). The example provided for this in (Dunning, 2011) is that of basketball. It is much harder to overestimate your performance in basketball, when you see that you missed the jump shot or the layup on the last 20 tries. Here, while the action is being performed by your legs and arms, the feedback is coming from your eyes and the basic knowledge of how basketball works as a sport. This makes it a much more effective feedback loop, and makes it so much harder to overestimate our own performance.
