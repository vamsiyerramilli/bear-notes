#  There is an element of risk involved with all our actions
Even with the most meticulous planning and strategy, there is always an element of risk that is almost unavoidable in all our decisions. A part of this risk stems from the randomness of events around us, that are all linked to different actions and triggers, many of which are beyond our control. There is also a certain amount of risk that is present due to our own ignorance about some of the factors that affect our decisions ([[We are overconfident about our own ability and knowledge when we are ignorant]]).

> Everything worth pursuing has <100% odds of being successful and risk is just what happens when you end up on the unfortunate side of that equation - Morgan Housel

[[There are always factors that we are unaware of, when we make decisions]], and these factors also have a huge impact on the outcome of our actions. These unknown-unknowns are why we always need to have a margin of safety in our investments, workflows and any other systems that we develop.
