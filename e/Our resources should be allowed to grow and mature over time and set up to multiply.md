# Our resources should be allowed to grow and mature over time and set up to multiply
Decisions today have a great impact on the outcomes tomorrow and yet, this is something that we neglect in our day to day life. A large part of our actions on a daily basis are geared towards the present outcomes - outcomes that we can realise within a short timeframe of action ([[Hyperbolic discounting]]). 

Many habits and behaviours which might be beneficial to us in the short term tend to be largely harmful in the longer run. Spending on amenities and possessions which feels good in the short term usually leaves us with little cash in the future for retirement. Building habits that feel good in the short term, such as smoking or excessive alcohol, tend to hurt us in the long term.

When we actively try to design our life and plans for resources such that they are [[Compounding]] over time, we are allowing ourselves to look past the immediate benefits and gauge the benefits from a more long term perspective ([[Design strategies that help multiply the inputs over time, and not just add up]]). This can be done with all the great resources that all / most of us have around us, through the right investment and efforts:
* Friends and family
* Health
* Time
* Education and Learning
* Money
