# We are overconfident about our own ability and knowledge when we are ignorant
Our confidence about a subject or topic is probably at its highest when we just begin to learn about it. This could be due to a few reasons, including the lack of awareness on the complexity and nuance of the subject and, the absence of feedback. However, as we dive into the subject and try to improve our understanding and gain more insight, we start to see a drop in confidence and the scope for learning and thinking actively increases. This is due to the [[Dunning Kruger Effect]]

* [[There is an element of risk involved with all our actions]]
	* Even with the most meticulous planning and strategy, there is always an element of risk that is almost unavoidable in all our decisions. A part of this risk stems from the randomness of events around us, that are all linked to different actions and triggers, many of which are beyond our control. There is also a certain amount of risk that is present due to our own ignorance about some of the factors that affect our decisions ([[We are overconfident about our own ability and knowledge when we are ignorant]]).
* [[A feedback loop distinct from the action helps gauge performance levels better]]
	* When the feedback loop and the core action rely on the same set of skills, there is a higher chance of error when it comes to performance measurement. This is driven by [[Dunning Kruger Effect]], where [[We are overconfident about our own ability and knowledge when we are ignorant]]. For example, if you are reading a new topic and want to test your understanding of it, merely scanning your brain for the understanding will give you the impression that you are now well-versed in the subject, as your only feedback loop is reliant on your own knowledge (which is limited, and possibly wrong or incomplete).
* [[Knowing the boundaries of our knowledge helps us gauge our own abilities better]]
	* [[We are overconfident about our own ability and knowledge when we are ignorant]] about the topic or subject in question. This could lead us towards making some really stupid and dumb decisions in life, under the assumption that we are actually knowledgeable about the subject. While this might work out okay from time to time, many times, this could result in hurting our long term [[Compounding]] that we’ve set in motion, and defeat the model of trying to avoid the dumbest possible decisions in any situation ([[Invert the situation to see what you might be missing]]),
