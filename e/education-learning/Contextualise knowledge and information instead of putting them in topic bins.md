# Contextualise knowledge and information instead of putting them in topic bins
Good note taking allows us to think and deliberate on what we read, as we elaborate and write down what we learnt in our own words, and try to fit it into the context of everything else that we already know. This, not only helps with better understanding, but also with the retrieval of information, as [[Retrieval of information from memory is aided by contextualisation]]. This could be both our primary and secondary memory, as contextualisation helps create more links to the same notes, allowing for easier discovery.

When we move away from putting notes in their topic bins,  we also increase the chances of finding weak associations between related topics, which we might not have discovered, if they were classified based on the subject or topic that we are learning ([[Interesting links between topics across subjects are often lost when we treat them as unrelated modules]])

Also, contextualising notes based on how or where we want to find them (where they are the most relevant to our existing notes) allows us to discover these notes on a later date, even when we might not be actively looking for them. This could lead to some positive feedback loops for the entire note taking system and reinforce the behaviour ([[Workflows also should have built in reward mechanisms in order to encourage “positive behaviour”]])
