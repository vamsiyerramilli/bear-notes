# Confirmation Bias plays a significant part in influencing our insight into different topics
[[Confirmation bias]] influences a large part of what we “observe” in the world, irrespective of what our eyes see, and this is impacted by the information that we already posses at the time we are exposed to the new knowledge. We could choose to accept or deny what we are seeing, regardless of the truth behind it. This is almost an uncontrolled and unintentional response of ours and influences our decisions and behaviour a lot.

This also affects the way that we look at data and analyses in our life - areas where we tend to look for new patterns and identify insights that we might be missing out on - but might only end up grasping insights that strengthen our current understanding, rather than look for something new or counterintuitive from it. [[Counterintuitive insights should be processed with an open mind]]

Charles Darwin used to write down any new discovery or insight of his within the first 30 mins of finding it, because he realised that his brain would start rejecting the notion soon, and prefer holding onto his existing beliefs.
