# Compounding
Compounding, the way it is taught in school, is the principle through which our money grows rather quickly when we reinvest the interest that we make on an investment into buying more of the same asset. This leads to the amounts adding up quickly - almost multiplying - and leading to much bigger outcomes.

This also holds true for other “resources” in life, such as relations, habits, knowledge, etc.

* [[Counterintuitive insights should be processed with an open mind]]
	* [[Compounding]] is not intuitive at all, as we tend to think of accumulation as addition, rather than multiplication. This is mostly down to the fact that usually when we deal with accumulation, we are looking at small amounts and for a short period of time. However, true compounding is multiplicative in nature, where small amounts multiply over time to result in a much bigger (almost counterintuitively big) outcomes
	* We miss the point of [[Compounding]] here again, where very small and marginal improvements in the system in the short term - which have no real outcome right then - could add up to potentially large impact in the future
* [[Time is the secret ingredient of compounding]]
	* Value builds up, relations solidify, habits are formed and knowledge accretes when we are consistent with our efforts or inputs for a long enough period of time. In the short term, our inputs are often additive, but when we are consistent with them for a much longer period of time is when we start to realise the true potential of [[Compounding]]
* [[Our resources should be allowed to grow and mature over time and set up to multiply]]
	* When we actively try to design our life and plans for resources such that they are [[Compounding]] over time, we are allowing ourselves to look past the immediate benefits and gauge the benefits from a more long term perspective ([[Design strategies that help multiply the inputs over time, and not just add up]]). This can be done with all the great resources that all / most of us have around us, through the right investment and efforts:
* [[Knowing the boundaries of our knowledge helps us gauge our own abilities better]]
	* [[We are overconfident about our own ability and knowledge when we are ignorant]] about the topic or subject in question. This could lead us towards making some really stupid and dumb decisions in life, under the assumption that we are actually knowledgeable about the subject. While this might work out okay from time to time, many times, this could result in hurting our long term [[Compounding]] that we’ve set in motion, and defeat the model of trying to avoid the dumbest possible decisions in any situation ([[Invert the situation to see what you might be missing]]),
