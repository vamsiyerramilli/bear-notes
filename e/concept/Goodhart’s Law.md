# Goodhart’s Law
We usually set some measures in order to track our progress towards a certain goal. However, when we start making these measures our target, it stops being a good measure - especially when the measure can be achieved through other means or it was the wrong metric in the first place.

* [[Education is more than just a degree]]
	* A degree is supposed to be the proof to the world that you are well educated and aware of a certain set of topics or subjects. It is the metric that is used to determine the knowledge any person has, when offering them a certain role or deciding on how much weight needs to be placed on their opinion on a particular topic. However, this is a key distinction - it is just a metric which is available to make these decisions easier, and is not the whole truth about the actual knowledge that someone has on a certain subject ([[Goodhart’s Law]])
