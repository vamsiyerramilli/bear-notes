# Retrieval of information from memory is aided by contextualisation
Bundling concepts together with our own ideas, commentary and memories usually results in easier and better retrieval of information, as this allows us to deliberate on the concept and place it in relation to the information that we already have with us. 

Our brain finds it much easier to store and retrieve information in relation to other points that it already has in its “database”, as this allows us to traverse through lines of related thought.

	* Good note taking allows us to think and deliberate on what we read, as we elaborate and write down what we learnt in our own words, and try to fit it into the context of everything else that we already know. This, not only helps with better understanding, but also with the retrieval of information, as [[Retrieval of information from memory is aided by contextualisation]]. This could be both our primary and secondary memory, as contextualisation helps create more links to the same notes, allowing for easier discovery.
