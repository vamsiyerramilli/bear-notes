# Confirmation bias
We tend to search for, favour, recall and interpret information that supports or confirms our previously help beliefs and values. This usually affects us when we are trying to learn something new or contradictory that what we already know (irrespective of it being right or wrong), and could potentially play a big role in why we are bad at interpreting counterintuitive outcomes ([[Counterintuitive insights should be processed with an open mind]])

We could choose to accept or deny what we are seeing, regardless of the truth behind it. This is almost an uncontrolled and unintentional response of ours and influences our decisions and behaviour a lot.
