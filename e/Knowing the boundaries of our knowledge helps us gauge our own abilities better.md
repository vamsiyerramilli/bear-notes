# Knowing the boundaries of our knowledge helps us gauge our own abilities better
[[We are overconfident about our own ability and knowledge when we are ignorant]] about the topic or subject in question. This could lead us towards making some really stupid and dumb decisions in life, under the assumption that we are actually knowledgeable about the subject. While this might work out okay from time to time, many times, this could result in hurting our long term [[Compounding]] that we’ve set in motion, and defeat the model of trying to avoid the dumbest possible decisions in any situation ([[Invert the situation to see what you might be missing]]), 

Thus, it is always important to be cognisant of our own capabilities, and also the limits of our capabilities, when we are put in a situation that requires us to make a choice. This helps us take more reasonable, informed and measured decisions in life, and avoid the most obvious mistakes that are possible in the given scenario.

A simple rule of thumb can be followed in such situations - if you have to ask yourself a couple of times whether or not you are knowledgeable about a particular topic, you probably aren’t or the topic is somewhere on the boundary of your knowledge and you might be pushing it.
