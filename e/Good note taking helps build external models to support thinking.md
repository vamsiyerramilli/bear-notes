# Good note taking helps build external models to support thinking
Note taking allows us to rely on an external system - external to our brain and memory - to capture the information and knowledge that we gather over a period of time. This system allows us to switch contexts easily without being too hung up on the current problem ([[Zeigarnik Effect]]) and break down complex topics into smaller and denser concept blocks (atomic notes).

When we design a system of note taking that allows us to achieve our goals for knowledge, we enhance the value that any note taking system can generate for us over time. Traditional note taking is geared towards the archival and storage of information, rather than function as a tool that aids thinking and understanding. This needs to fundamentally change for us to use note taking as a way to build an external mental model of our knowledge.

A well designed note taking system should come with a few different systemic elements, such as
1. [[Workflows should have a distinct feedback loop built into them to move towards the desired outcome]]. 
	* Note taking should work as a framework to deliberate and think about what we are learning, and test this knowledge by writing down our understanding in our own words.
	* This creates a distinct feedback loop for our understanding and learning ([[A feedback loop distinct from the action helps gauge performance levels better]])
2. [[Contextualise knowledge and information instead of putting them in topic bins]] 
	* Contextualising notes helps us create a dense web of knowledge, which is highly interconnected and allows for the easy retrieval of information, if and when needed
	* This allows our external memory (notes) work in a similar way to our primary memory (brain), through context and association of themes and topics
3. [[Interesting links between topics across subjects are often lost when we treat them as unrelated modules]]
	* Good notes usually follow the principles of atomicity - where one note contains all the information about a specific topic - and are densely linked to other such notes in the “note universe” through context (see point above)
	* This allows us to build weak links between topics and findings which might not be evident at a first glance, but are related either directly or indirectly through specific context.
4. [[Retrieval of information from memory is aided by contextualisation]]
	* We improve the chances of storing a particular piece of information and retrieving it, per need, when we contextualise it with information that we already possess, and note taking geared towards improving understanding helps us improve our success rate at this
5. [[Design strategies that help multiply the inputs over time, and not just add up]]
	* Note taking should be geared towards understanding and developing thought, rather than archival or a dumping ground. When we just use notes as a scratch pad, it might help us with the task at hand, but we are not building out a repository of information that can be relied upon in the future.
	* Adding a structure to note taking, and effortfully linking them up to form chains of contextual thought often helps us in the long run, while demanding little from us in the short term
