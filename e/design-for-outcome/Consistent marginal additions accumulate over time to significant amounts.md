# Consistent marginal additions accumulate over time to significant amounts
We often imagine that exceptional outcomes are a result of exceptional efforts and investment, and this is not entirely true. In most cases, even more than exceptional efforts, it is the ability to do the most average thing consistently that results in exceptional outcomes.

> “The man who can do the most average thing when all those around him are doing crazy” was Napolean’s idea of a military genius

When marginal contributions are all geared towards the same outcome and are set up in a way that they can multiply over time, the results are often surprising. With consistency, we leverage the power of time in compounding. This principle holds true on multiple fronts in life, including investing, knowledge, habits, behaviours, relations, etc.

The key point to keep in mind here is to ensure we do not do something stupid, and break the cycle of contribution. ([[Invert the situation to see what you might be missing]]). 

Also, [[There is an element of risk involved with all our actions]], but in the long run, this should average out and result in a net positive, if your addition is consistent.

	* There are two ingredients which make up a good recipe for compounding - consistency, which is discussed in [[Consistent marginal additions accumulate over time to significant amounts]], and time.

	* While inputs tend to be additive in the short term, they usually end up becoming multiplicative in the long run, through consistency and avoiding stupid decisions ([[Consistent marginal additions accumulate over time to significant amounts]], [[Time is the secret ingredient of compounding]]) - this is not something that seems very obvious at first, but does hold up in more than one field ([[Counterintuitive insights should be processed with an open mind]])
