# Simple workflows often form the core of working towards very complex outcomes
For a lot of our work, it is important to design workflows that work make sense to us and work for us. While each person has different needs and motivations for their process, it is good to always follow certain simple rules, which can get you a long way there.

Some of these rules include:
1. [[Predictability is important for the formation of habits]] With any workflow design, the core motivation is to be able to consistently work towards a desired outcome. With a predictable workflow, we can build up our habits to work towards this outcome in the long run.
2. [[Simple structures are usually modular and allow more flexibility in set up]] Modularity and flexibility allow us to design custom workflows, which are dedicated to our goals and ways of working, thus reducing the potential friction that we could encounter when we try to replicate others’ complex systems.
3. Room for experimentation
4. Avoid confusion
