# Education is more than just a degree
A degree is supposed to be the proof to the world that you are well educated and aware of a certain set of topics or subjects. It is the metric that is used to determine the knowledge any person has, when offering them a certain role or deciding on how much weight needs to be placed on their opinion on a particular topic. However, this is a key distinction - it is just a metric which is available to make these decisions easier, and is not the whole truth about the actual knowledge that someone has on a certain subject ([[Goodhart‚Äôs Law]])

Today, a large part of the world runs with this metric of a degree and marks as a validation for the knowledge that a person has, but might be missing out on core motivation behind their decisions - what was the degree supposed to signify and does the person actually have the necessary qualifications?

Another pitfall of measuring education through such metrics is that it could get outdated really quickly, with the ever changing and growing world around us. In such cases, if we want to stay ‚Äúeducated‚Äù in a changing world, [[Our resources should be allowed to grow and mature over time and set up to multiply]] - in this particular case, our knowledge resource.
