# Design strategies that help multiply the inputs over time, and not just add up
We are often looking at ways to improve our returns from the same limited input that we hold in multiple fields like investing, knowledge, habits, behaviours, relations, etc. In all these cases, we tend to consider the inputs to work in an additive fashion, as this is much more intuitive to us. 

While inputs tend to be additive in the short term, they usually end up becoming multiplicative in the long run, through consistency and avoiding stupid decisions ([[Consistent marginal additions accumulate over time to significant amounts]], [[Time is the secret ingredient of compounding]]) - this is not something that seems very obvious at first, but does hold up in more than one field ([[Counterintuitive insights should be processed with an open mind]])

For our inputs to multiply over a period of time, we need to prime them for this purpose and ensure they are equipped to multiply. For different fields, this needs to be done in different ways, and it is always important to design a strategy that is tailored for the situation and for our desired outcomes.
