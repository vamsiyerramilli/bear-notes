# Predictability is important for the formation of habits
Our brain works on a process of pattern recognition and association to a great extent. When we get the same outcome for a particular action, there is a higher chance of habit formation within our brains, and this is a powerful leverage that we hold; something that can be used to our advantage. 

When we perform an action expecting a certain reward, getting the reward as expected has a high dopamine release within our brains, and this usually has a positive effect on our motivation. Not getting this reward per expectation actually tends to have a worse impact on our motivation, and this could end up affecting our actual output from the action itself.
