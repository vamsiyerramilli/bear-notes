# Breaking down complex subjects into smaller, related modules makes it easier for instructors to explain subjects
Throughout our formal learning, we have different subjects or courses, all of which again have distinct chapters and topics in them. This is divided up in order to make it easier for anyone to learn the topics.

It enables the instructors to prepare for explaining “bite-sized” topics at any given point, instead of having to going off on multiple tangents for every single topic being discussed

	* Through our formal learning, we breakdown the knowledge into different grades, subjects and chapters, all of which come together to make up the  bulk of our school and college learning. This structure enables the instructors to easily focus on a particular topic and share the knowledge on the single topic, before moving to the next.
