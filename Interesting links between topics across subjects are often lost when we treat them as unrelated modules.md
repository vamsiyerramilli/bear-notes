# Interesting links between topics across subjects are often lost when we treat them as unrelated modules
Through our formal learning, we breakdown the knowledge into different grades, subjects and chapters, all of which come together to make up the  bulk of our school and college learning. This structure enables the instructors to easily focus on a particular topic and share the knowledge on the single topic, before moving to the next. ([[Breaking down complex subjects into smaller, related modules makes it easier for instructors to explain subjects]])

The problem, however, is that when the subject is broken down into smaller modules, we (students) tend to silo them into separate buckets and do not see the weak links between associated topics.

Identifying these weak links and building connections across subjects can result in improved understanding, retention and retrieval of information ([[Retrieval of information from memory is aided by contextualisation]])
