I am back to Bear! This flip flop that I keep doing is actually keeping me from doing anything productive in life. This is such an instinctive decision that I took, I cannot believe it. After all that time trying to move to Roam and actually doing it fairly successfully, I realise that this is just better.

Is it because it is cheaper? Is it because I want to keep switching between apps to keep myself occupied during downtimes when I do not feel like doing some actual work on the notes or topics? I don’t know. I really am craving some change right now, and I think Bear brings a good deal of that (ironically, given the app’s development is so fucking slow)
