	- [x] Send an email to Shiny Frog, with my resume and a cover letter, describing some of my own skills
	* I’ll just write about why I love Bear so much and why I would love to work with / help them with some of their potential requirements in terms of people support
	* Will also just mention that if there are no positions open and nothing they need help with, that’s completely fine and that I just wanted to drop a note to inform them how awesome the app itself is anyway

	* [[Jerry Garcia]] is a fucking God! Money Honey has such beautiful guitar jams!
* 15:36
	* Fuck my life, I just got that Roam scholarship! It’s the same thing that happened with Notion and Mem a while back
	* I need to, however, make a decision and stick with it. I really liked Bear way of working
	* Roam is a bit too finicky for my to try out right now. If I pay up for the subscription, I’ll be forced to continue to use it.
	* I can maybe see if there is a way to use it as my public garden, and just upload everything from Bear to it periodically 
	* Basically, bear notes exported in markdown, just uploaded to Roam 
	* This is all much lower priority right now. I think the higher priority for me is to add permanent notes into Bear
	* I was having a lot of fun thinking about this yesterday and today morning
	* Certainly something that I want to keep at 
	* I need to simplify my entire system and Bear allows me to do that very well
	* I’m sure a simple system is possible on Roam as well, except that I tend to get influenced by all the “beautiful setups” 
	* Also, if a feature is present, I’d probably use it. But if it is not, then I wouldn’t 
	* One good thing about Roam - outlining - something that’s a way away in Bear
